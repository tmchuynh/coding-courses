      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h5>Where kids become creators, not just consumers.</h5>
      <div className="gap-4 grid lg:grid-cols-2">
        <div>
          <p>
            We‚Äôre a team of educators, developers, designers, and dreamers who
            believe that every child should have the opportunity to shape the
            future with technology. Founded on the belief that computer science
            is a basic literacy in the digital age, we created a learning
            environment where young minds can explore, build, and grow through
            the power of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our programs are designed to be inclusive, engaging, and relevant to
            today‚Äôs world. We believe that coding is not just about learning a
            language; it‚Äôs about developing a mindset of innovation, resilience,
            and collaboration. We strive to create a space where every student
            feels empowered to explore their interests, express their ideas, and
            take ownership of their learning journey.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            We are proud to be a part of the movement to democratize access to
            computer science education. We work tirelessly to ensure that our
            programs are accessible to all students, regardless of their
            background or prior experience. We believe that diversity in tech is
            not just a goal‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. By fostering an inclusive
            environment, we aim to inspire the next generation of innovators,
            creators, and leaders who will shape the future of technology.

          <p>
            At our core, we are more than just a coding academy. We are a
            community of mentors and makers committed to helping kids unlock
            their potential‚Äîby turning curiosity into capability and creativity
            into confidence.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p className="mb-2 italic">
            It started with a simple question:
            <br />
            ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt every child learning how to code?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            From that question came a mission‚Äîto close the opportunity gap in
            computer science education. We saw firsthand how many students
            lacked access to the tools and support needed to thrive in an
            increasingly digital world. So we built a solution from the ground
            up: an inclusive, engaging, and forward-thinking curriculum tailored
            to the needs of students from all backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a local after-school program has grown into a thriving
            educational movement, offering both in-person and online learning
            experiences for students ages 7‚Äì18. Today, we serve hundreds of
            families through year-round programs, summer camps, and school
            partnerships.

          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <h5>Building future-ready thinkers.</h5>
          <p>
            We teach kids how to code‚Äîbut more than that, we teach them how to
            think, create, and lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our approach is rooted in the belief that coding is a powerful tool
            for self-expression and problem-solving. We focus on hands-on,
            project-based learning that encourages students to explore their
            interests, collaborate with peers, and develop critical thinking
            skills.

            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Hands-On Learning:</span> Every
              class is project-based, so students learn by building real things
              that matter to them‚Äîgames, websites, animations, apps, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Tech for All:</span> Our programs
              are designed with accessibility in mind. We actively work to
              reduce barriers for students with limited access to technology or
              those with learning differences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Real-World Skills:</span> In
              addition to technical ability, our students develop critical
              21st-century skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and digital
              citizenship.

          <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>
          <h5>Empowering kids through code..</h5>
          <p>
            We measure our success not just by the lines of code written, but by
            the lives changed. Our students leave our programs with more than
            just technical skills‚Äîthey gain confidence, resilience, and a sense
            of belonging in the tech world.
