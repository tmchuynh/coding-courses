      <h1>Why Learn How to Code?</h1>
      <h5>
        Empowering the Next Generation with Tools to Build, Solve, and Create in
        a Digital World
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In today‚Äôs digital world, coding is a fundamental skill that empowers
        children to understand and shape the technology around them. Learning to
        code is not just about writing lines of code; it‚Äôs about developing a
        mindset that embraces problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.
        Coding is a valuable skill that opens doors to countless opportunities
        in the future. It‚Äôs not just for aspiring programmers; it‚Äôs a skill that
        can benefit anyone in any field. Whether your child dreams of becoming a
        game developer, engineer, or entrepreneur, learning to code opens up
        endless possibilities.

        <h2>The Future of Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is transforming every aspect of our lives‚Äîfrom how we
          communicate to how we work, learn, shop, and solve problems. It‚Äôs no
          longer confined to tech companies; it‚Äôs at the heart of nearly every
          industry, from healthcare and finance to agriculture, education, and
          the arts. As digital transformation accelerates, the need for
          individuals who understand how technology works‚Äîand can build with
          it‚Äîis growing rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2030, a significant percentage of jobs will require at least a
          basic understanding of programming, data literacy, or computational
          thinking. The World Economic Forum predicts that more than 85 million
          jobs may be displaced by automation, while 97 million new roles could
          emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labor between
          humans, machines, and algorithms. In other words, coding won‚Äôt just be
          for software engineers‚Äîit will be a fundamental part of many future
          professions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early exposure to coding ensures your child is not just keeping up,
          but staying ahead. When children learn to code at a young age, they
          are developing the thinking patterns, problem-solving habits, and
          creative skills that will serve them for a lifetime. They're learning
          how to build with technology instead of just using it passively.
          They're also acquiring the adaptability needed to thrive in a future
          filled with emerging fields like artificial intelligence, robotics,
          quantum computing, and augmented reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as literacy and numeracy became foundational skills in the 20th
          century, digital fluency‚Äîparticularly coding‚Äîis becoming the new core
          competency of the 21st century. And because the jobs of tomorrow may
          not exist yet, teaching children how to think like innovators,
          engineers, and creators today is the most powerful way to future-proof
          their education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether your child dreams of becoming a game designer, doctor,
          environmental scientist, entrepreneur, or artist, coding will amplify
          their potential. It‚Äôs not just about getting a head start in tech‚Äîit‚Äôs
          about equipping them with the mindset and tools to shape the future.
