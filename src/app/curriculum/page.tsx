        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            <strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Coding teaches children how
            to break down complex problems and find logical solutions. For
            example, when writing a program, kids learn to identify issues,
            debug errors, and think critically about how to improve their
            solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creativity:</strong> Programming encourages kids to create
            games, stories, and apps, turning their ideas into reality. Children
            can design their own interactive stories or build simple games,
            fostering imagination and innovation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confidence:</strong> Building projects and overcoming
            challenges helps boost self-esteem and resilience. Completing a
            coding project gives children a sense of accomplishment and
            motivates them to tackle new challenges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Many coding projects involve
            teamwork, helping children develop communication and social skills.
            Working together on group projects or participating in coding clubs
            teaches kids how to share ideas and solve problems as a team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital Literacy:</strong> Understanding how technology
            works prepares children for a digital world. Coding helps demystify
            the devices and apps they use every day, making them more informed
            and responsible digital citizens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Math and Logic:</strong> Programming reinforces math
            concepts and logical thinking. Kids apply sequencing, pattern
            recognition, and basic arithmetic in real-world contexts.
