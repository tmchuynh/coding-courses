        "Coding teaches children how to break down complex problems and find logical solutions.",
      detail: (
        <>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Problem-solving is a foundational
          skill for life and learning. Coding encourages kids to analyze
          challenges, break them into smaller steps, and develop step-by-step
          solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> When debugging a program, children learn to
          identify issues, test hypotheses, and iterate until they find a
          solution. This process builds resilience and adaptability, skills that
          are valuable in any field.

        "Programming encourages kids to create games, stories, and apps, turning their ideas into reality.",
      detail: (
        <>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coding is a creative outlet that lets
          children bring their imagination to life. They can design interactive
          stories, animations, or games, and see their ideas take shape on the
          screen.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Kids can build their own
          choose-your-own-adventure stories or invent new games, learning to
          express themselves in new digital ways.

      summary:
        "Building projects and overcoming challenges helps boost self-esteem and resilience.",
      detail: (
        <>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Completing a coding project gives
          children a sense of accomplishment. Overcoming obstacles and seeing
          their work come to life builds confidence and encourages them to take
          on new challenges.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> When a child successfully creates an app or
          solves a tough bug, they gain the confidence to try more ambitious
          projects in the future.

      detail: (
        <>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coding is often a team effort.
          Working with others on group projects or in coding clubs teaches kids
          to communicate, share ideas, and solve problems together.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> In a robotics club, children might work
          together to design, build, and program a robot, learning to listen,
          compromise, and celebrate shared successes.

        "Understanding how technology works prepares children for a digital world.",
      detail: (
        <>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coding helps demystify the technology
          that surrounds us. Kids learn how apps, websites, and devices work,
          making them more informed and responsible digital citizens.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> By building their own websites or apps,
          children gain a deeper appreciation for the technology they use every
          day and learn to use it safely and ethically.

      summary: "Programming reinforces math concepts and logical thinking.",
      detail: (
        <>
          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coding naturally integrates math and
          logic, helping kids apply concepts like sequencing, pattern
          recognition, and arithmetic in real-world contexts.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Writing a program to calculate scores in a
          game or create patterns with code helps children see the practical
          side of math and logic.
