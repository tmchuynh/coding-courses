    summary:
      "Coding challenges children to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. It teaches them to analyze situations, identify patterns, and develop solutions logically. This approach to thinking translates directly to success in math, science, and real-life situations.",

      <>
        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Problem-solving is a foundational skill
        for life and learning. Coding encourages kids to analyze challenges,
        break them into smaller steps, and develop step-by-step solutions.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> When debugging a program, children learn to
        identify issues, test hypotheses, and iterate until they find a
        solution. This process builds resilience and adaptability, skills that
        are valuable in any field.

    summary:
      "Through coding, children can bring their ideas to life‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a video game, a digital story, or a custom app. It turns them from passive users of technology into active creators, giving them a sense of empowerment and ownership over their work.",

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coding is a creative outlet that lets
        children bring their imagination to life. They can design interactive
        stories, animations, or games, and see their ideas take shape on the
        screen.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> Kids can build their own
        choose-your-own-adventure stories or invent new games, learning to
        express themselves in new digital ways.

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Building resilience helps children
        handle setbacks without giving up. Coding teaches that errors are
        opportunities to learn.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> When faced with a non-working game or
        animation, children learn to troubleshoot methodically and try new
        approaches until they find a solution.

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Completing a coding project gives
        children a sense of accomplishment. Overcoming obstacles and seeing
        their work come to life builds confidence and encourages them to take on
        new challenges.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> When a child successfully creates an app or
        solves a tough bug, they gain the confidence to try more ambitious
        projects in the future.

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coding is often a team effort. Working
        with others on group projects or in coding clubs teaches kids to
        communicate, share ideas, and solve problems together.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> In a robotics club, children might work
        together to design, build, and program a robot, learning to listen,
        compromise, and celebrate shared successes.

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> In today‚Äôs digital world, understanding
        the basics of software and systems is essential. Coding helps children
        think critically about how digital platforms function.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> A child who codes a simple website or app
        gains insights into how search engines, games, and social platforms are
        built‚Äîand becomes a more mindful digital citizen.

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Many coding principles mirror
        foundational math concepts like variables, functions, and sequences.
        This makes abstract math more engaging and relevant.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong> A child might use loops to solve a pattern
        problem or apply conditional logic to create interactive elements in a
        game, blending math and logic in a fun and applied context.
